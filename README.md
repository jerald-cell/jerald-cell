- 👋 Hi, I’m @jerald-cell
- 👀 I’m interested in just about anything to do with working and of course software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about using canvas.js, svg.js, react.js, and node.js. I've got extensive knowledge with Java, Javascript, C, C++, HTML, CSS, etc. I love building
robust reactive UI's and applications for users. Helping solve a problem with a software solution highly motivates me. My drive for helping others is unparralled,
I love to lead, learn, and develop as much as I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects utilizing javascript. I also am seeking work, for javascript developement, java, and or python.
- 📫 How to reach me, You can reach me at jeraldhollingsworth10@gmail.com
